NorthernLights Hospital is a small healthcare facility located in northern Canada. Due to a lack of money, they have had to make do with outdated paper and DOS-like programs to
track patients. Although the employees are very familiar with the old system and rarely make mistakes (or know how to fix them if they do), NLH feels it is time to update the
system. The hospital board was very impressed with the proposal to design, develop and maintain the patient tracking system put forward by the senior developer and awarded the
contract to Soft.

You need to import NHL.mdf into the SQl server and change [DESKTOP-E0AOPGN\MSSQLSERVER01] in the SqlConnection command to your server name. <br>
